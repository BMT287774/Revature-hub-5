SQL REASEARCH NOTES 12/21-12/25;

1) RDBMS(Relational Database Management System)

a Relational Database refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns.
This makes it easy to to locate and access specific values within the database. it is "relational" because 
the values within each table are related to each other. Tables may also be related to other tables. The relational
structure makes it possible to run queries across multiple tables at once.

While a RDBMS describes the type of database an RDBMS manages. It all refers to the program itself.
It can also provide a viual representation of the data. For example, it may display data in a table like a spreadsheet.

Most well known DBMS applications fall into the RDBMS category:
 - Oracle Database  - Microsoft SQL Server
 - MySQL            - IBM DB2

2) Normalization(1NF, 2NF, 3NF)

Normalization is a series of steps followed to obtain a database design that allows for efficient access and storage of data.
these steps reduce data redundancy and the chances of data becoming inconsistent. 

First Normal Form(1NF)

First normal form eliminates repeating groups by putting each into a separate table and connecting them with a one-to-many relationship.

Two Rules follows this definition:
1. Each table has a primary key made of one of severa fields and uniquely identifying each record.
2. Each field is atomic, it does not contain more than one value

Second Normal Form(2NF)

Second normal form requires that every non-key attribute must depend on the whole of every candidate key and not on just a part of a key.

Third Normal Form(3NF)

Third normal form requires that non-key attributes moust depend on only composite keys. To fulfill this normal form it is necessary
to put all fields that are in functional dependencies on non-key fields in a state in a separate table. At this stage, all non-key fields
are dependent on the whole of every key and nothing but the key.

4) SQL Sublanguages

DDL (Data Definition Language)
-Used to define Database objects like TABLE, VIEW, SEQUENCE, INDEX, SYNONYM creation or modification
or removing.
-CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME are the DDL commands

DML (Data Manipulation Language)
-Used to manipulate the data in Database objects like table, view, index
-INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE are the DML commands.

DQL (Data Query Language)
-Used to retreive information from the database objects. It is for read only purpose.
-SELECT is the DQL command.

TCL (Transaction Control Language)
-Transaction control statement are use to apply the changes permanently save into the database.
-COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, ROLLBACK TO, are the TCL commands.

DCL (Data Control Language)
-Data control statements are use to give privileges to acces limited data or share the information between users.
-GRANT, REVOKE, AUDIT, COMMENT, ANALYZE are the DCL commands.

5) SQL Constraints and integrity 

Unique Key: A column whose values must be unique in each row
Primary Key: A column whose values uniquely identify each row
Composite Key: Two or more columns acting together as a primary key
Foreign Key: A column in one table that references a column in another table
NOT NULL: The column must have a value in each row
CHECK: The column values must meet some criteria
